DESCRIPTION
    When you define a function, or import one, into a Perl package, it will
    naturally also be available as a method. This does not per se cause
    problems, but it can complicate subclassing and, for example, plugin
    classes that are included by loading them as base classes.

    The "namespace::clean" pragma will remove all previously declared or
    imported symbols at the end of the current package's compile cycle. This
    means that functions are already bound by their name, and calls to them
    still work. But they will not be available as methods on your class or
    instances.

METHODS
    You shouldn't need to call any of these. Just "use" the package at the
    appropriate place.

  import
    Makes a snapshot of the current defined functions and registers a
    Filter::EOF cleanup routine to remove those symbols from the package at
    the end of the compile-time.

  get_functions
    Takes a class as argument and returns all currently defined functions in
    it as a hash reference with the function name as key and a typeglob
    reference to the symbol as value.

SEE ALSO
    Filter::EOF
